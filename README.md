CHi â€” Conditional Hierarchy Style Manager<br />
_An upload of [Unity Asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/chi-conditional-hierarchy-style-manager-37108) I made in 2017. It is not in development since then_


Change your hierarchy items styles (icons, background, text color) in a few clicks by layer, tag or enabled/disabled state

Set styles by conditions of any complexity with a few lines of code
